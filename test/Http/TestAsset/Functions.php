 * This file exists to allow overriding the various output-related functions
 * in order to test what happens during the `Server::listen()` cycle.
 *
 * These functions include:
 *
 * - headers_sent(): we want to always return false so that headers will be
 *   emitted, and we can test to see their values.
 * - header(): we want to aggregate calls to this function.
 * - printf(): we want to aggregate calls to this function as well; we cannot
 *   do the same with echo as it's a language construct, not a function.
 *
 * The Output class then aggregates that information for us, and the test
 * harness resets the values pre and post test.
